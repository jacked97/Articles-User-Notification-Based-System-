REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

git clone https://github.com/jacked97/Articles-User-Notification-Based-System-.git
Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/application-folder-name/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.
